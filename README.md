# UFOs

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time through the use of HTML and Javascript.

## Results
To begin we expanding our search box to include several other fields that will allow the user the ability to have a much more refined search parameters. This is expecially useful because of the vast amount of data that is included in our table.

Our webpage has a dynamic function that allows users to add multiple filters to really hone in their search, and as each form is filled out our table automatically adjusts the table to include those filters as shown below.

Along with the filter we added a function at the top-left of the webpage that resets the filter as well as the table, giving users a quick and easy way to reset their search.

## Summary

### Drawback
While useful and fast, our website certainly has room for improvement. One of the biggest drawbacks of our table filter is the inflexibility of the user input. The user must input their search's exactly to the format of the table, an example of this is case sensitivity in cities.

### Recommendations
1. In order to improve our user experience, update the code to allow for case sensitivity when filtering the table and different formats for the Duration entry.
2. Another improvement to the site would be the ability for users to enter a date range if they would like to see a certain number of sighting for a month or year.
